# How to Determine Whether Any Year is a Leap Year?
#
# To determine whether any given year is a leap year, follow these steps:
#   - If the year is evenly divisible by four, then go to step 2. Otherwise, go to step 5.
#   - If the year is evenly divisible by a hundred, then go to step 3. Otherwise, go to step 4.
#   - If the year is evenly divisible by four hundred, then go to step 4. Otherwise, you can go to step 5.
#   - The year is a leap year (if it has 366 days).
#   - The year is not a leap year (if it has 365 days).

# TODO: finish this script
# using C style for loop syntax
for ((YEAR="$(date +%Y)"; YEAR<=(($YEAR + 5)); YEAR++))
  do
  if [[ $(($YEAR % 4)) -eq 0 ]]
  then
    echo "$YEAR"
    break
  else
    # echo "$YEAR =  not a leap year"
  fi
done
