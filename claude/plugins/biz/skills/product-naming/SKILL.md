# Product Naming & Marketing Strategy

## Profile Integration

If `profiles/business-profile.md` exists, check:
- **Target markets**: French, English, both? Naming must work in target languages.
- **Brand preferences**: Personality, tone, visual style
- **Domain expertise**: Informs positioning credibility
- **Budget constraints**: Affects marketing channel recommendations

If a completed `saas-intake` questionnaire exists for this project, use it for:
- Target customer profile
- Competitive landscape
- Value proposition inputs
- Pricing context

## Part 1: Product Naming

### Naming Approaches

Present these options when the user asks for naming help:

| Approach | Example | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|----------|---------|------|------|----------|
| **Descriptive** | TaskManager, InvoiceFlow | Instant understanding, SEO | Generic, hard to trademark | Utility tools, clear-function products |
| **Invented** | Slack, Stripe, Zoom | Unique, memorable, strong brand | Needs marketing investment | Well-funded products, platforms |
| **Compound** | GitHub, MailChimp, SalesForce | Familiar elements, brandable | Can be long | Products combining two concepts |
| **Abstract** | Apple, Oracle, Sage | Emotional, flexible evolution | Requires brand building | Premium products, long-term brands |

### Naming Workflow

1. **Gather inputs**: Product description, target user, key differentiator, market(s)
2. **Generate 10-15 candidates** across multiple approaches
3. **Filter by availability**: Domain, trademark, social handles, app stores
4. **Evaluate survivors** against criteria below
5. **Present top 3-5** with rationale for each
6. **Help user decide** based on priorities

### Evaluation Criteria

Score each candidate 1-5:

| Criterion | Weight | Check |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Memorable** | ×3 | Can someone remember it after hearing it once? |
| **Spellable** | ×2 | Can someone type it correctly after hearing it? |
| **Pronounceable** | ×3 | Works in target languages? No awkward sounds? |
| **Domain available** | ×3 | .com available? .fr? Acceptable alternatives? |
| **Trademark clear** | ×2 | No conflicts on INPI (France) and USPTO? |
| **Scalable** | ×1 | Works if the product expands beyond initial scope? |
| **Emotional fit** | ×2 | Matches the desired brand personality? |
| **SEO potential** | ×1 | Will it rank or get lost in noise? |

### French Market Naming Considerations

When the product targets French speakers:
- **Pronunciation**: Must be natural for French speakers (avoid "th", difficult consonant clusters)
- **Spelling**: Intuitive — if it sounds French, spell it French; if English, keep English spelling
- **Length**: 5-8 characters ideal
- **Accents**: Avoid accented characters in brand names (domain/URL complications)
- **Cultural check**: Verify no unintended meanings in French slang
- **Double meaning**: Some English words have different connotations in French — always check

### Technical Naming Requirements
- Works as subdomain: `app.name.com`
- Works as npm package / GitHub org (no special characters)
- Professional in email: `hello@name.com`
- Clear in voice assistants (Siri, Alexa)
- Not too similar to existing tech products

## Part 2: Brand Positioning

### Value Proposition Formula

Generate value propositions using this framework:

> **[Product]** helps **[persona]** **[achieve outcome]** by **[unique approach]**, unlike **[alternative]** which **[limitation]**.

Example: "Notion helps knowledge workers organize everything in one place by combining docs, wikis, and project management, unlike Google Docs which fragments your workspace across apps."

### Positioning Dimensions

Help the user position on these axes:
- **Price**: Premium vs budget vs freemium
- **Complexity**: Simple vs powerful
- **Market**: Niche vs broad
- **Approach**: Opinionated vs flexible
- **Target**: Individual vs team vs enterprise

### Key Messages Hierarchy
1. **Primary message**: Core value proposition (one sentence)
2. **Supporting messages**: 3-5 key benefits
3. **Proof points**: Stats, testimonials, credibility markers
4. **Call to action**: Clear next step

---

## Part 3: Landing Page Strategy

### Page Structure Framework

When asked to plan a landing page:

1. **Hero**: Clear value proposition + primary CTA + visual
2. **Problem/Solution**: Address specific pain points the persona feels
3. **Features**: 3-5 key capabilities with benefit-focused descriptions
4. **Social proof**: Testimonials, usage stats, logos, reviews
5. **Pricing**: Clear, transparent structure (if applicable)
6. **FAQ**: Address top 5-7 objections
7. **Final CTA**: Repeat primary conversion action

### French Landing Page Requirements
- **Legal**: CGV (conditions générales de vente), mentions légales, privacy policy
- **Pricing**: Display prices with TVA (VAT included)
- **Support**: Indicate French language support availability
- **Trust**: French security badges, GDPR compliance statement
- **Payment**: Show accepted payment methods (CB, PayPal, virement)

---

## Part 4: Pricing Strategy

### Model Options

| Model | Best For | Complexity | Revenue Predictability |
|-------|----------|------------|----------------------|
| **Freemium** | High-volume consumer apps | Medium | Low initially |
| **Tiered subscription** | B2B SaaS, most products | Medium | High |
| **Usage-based** | APIs, infrastructure tools | High | Medium |
| **Flat rate** | Simple tools, solo users | Low | High |
| **Per-seat** | Team collaboration tools | Low | High |

### Pricing Psychology
- Use anchor pricing (show expensive tier first)
- Highlight recommended/popular tier
- Annual discount: 15-20% is standard
- Free tier: generous enough to be useful, limited enough to drive upgrades
- Round numbers in local currency (€9, €29, €99 — not €9.37)

### French Market Pricing
- Always show TTC (toutes taxes comprises / VAT included)
- Consider SEPA direct debit option
- French customers expect annual payment discounts
- Price sensitivity varies by segment — research competitors

## Part 5: Competitive Comparison Pages

When asked to create comparison content:

### Framework
1. **Feature comparison table**: Side-by-side, honest (acknowledge competitor strengths)
2. **Pricing comparison**: Transparent cost analysis
3. **Use case scenarios**: "Choose [us] if... Choose [them] if..."
4. **Migration guide**: How to switch (reduces friction)
5. **Customer stories**: Real switching testimonials

### Guidelines
- Be factual, not snarky
- Acknowledge competitor strengths
- Focus on YOUR unique advantages, not their weaknesses
- Keep comparison data current (outdated = loss of trust)
- Include "Try free" CTA prominently

---

## Part 6: Content Marketing

### Content Pillars (suggest 3-5 based on product)

1. **Educational**: How-to guides, best practices
2. **Industry insights**: Market trends, analysis
3. **Customer success**: Case studies, user stories
4. **Product updates**: Feature announcements, roadmap
5. **Thought leadership**: Opinion pieces, industry commentary

### French Content SEO
- Research French keywords (not just translate English ones)
- Use French business examples and scenarios
- Reference French regulations and business context
- Professional but approachable tone (less casual than US content)
- Consider both French and English content strategies separately

## Workflow

When the user asks for naming/marketing help:

1. **Clarify scope**: Naming only? Full positioning? Landing page? All of the above?
2. **Gather context**: Check profile + project questionnaire, ask for missing info
3. **Deliver in stages**: Name first → positioning → landing page → pricing
4. **Iterate**: Present options, get feedback, refine
5. **Document**: Save final decisions for the project
