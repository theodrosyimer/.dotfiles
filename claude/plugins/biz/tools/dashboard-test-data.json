CBT-i apps assume ideal schedules. No solution connects sleep data to calendar/lifestyle for personalized recommendations.\n\n### Solution Approach\n\n**Core Solution**: AI sleep coach that ingests wearable data + calendar, identifies personal sleep drivers, and delivers adaptive micro-recommendations that fit your actual schedule.\n\n**Key Features**:\n1. Wearable data sync (Oura, Apple Watch, Fitbit) — unified sleep dashboard\n2. Calendar integration — detects late meetings, travel, timezone shifts\n3. Personal correlation engine — finds YOUR sleep drivers (caffeine cutoff, screen time, exercise timing)\n4. Adaptive micro-coaching — 1-2 daily nudges that respect your real schedule\n5. Weekly insight reports — what moved the needle this week, data-backed\n\n**MVP Scope**: Oura Ring sync + manual log + basic correlation analysis + 3 coaching nudges/day\n\n**Future Vision**: Full health OS connecting sleep to productivity, fitness, and nutrition data",

          "phase1": "# Phase 1: Problem Validation\n## Project: sleepwell\n## Date: 2026-02-18\n\n---\n\n## Findings Summary\nSleep dissatisfaction is widespread and well-documented. The specific gap between \"tracking sleep\" and \"improving sleep\" is a consistent complaint across communities. People own wearables but feel the data isn't actionable.\n\n## Evidence & Sources\n- r/sleep: 450K+ members, weekly threads about \"my Oura says I slept badly but doesn't help me fix it\"\n- r/OuraRing: Frequent posts asking \"what should I actually DO with this data?\"\n- App Store reviews for Sleep Cycle, Pillow, AutoSleep: 3-star reviews saying \"great tracking, no advice\"\n- Huberman Lab podcast episodes on sleep get 2-5M views each — massive interest\n\n## Key Quotes & Signals\n- \"I've been tracking my sleep for 2 years and I still don't know what to change\" — r/QuantifiedSelf, 847 upvotes\n- \"CBT-i apps assume I can go to bed at 10pm. I'm a founder, that's not happening.\" — Indie Hackers forum\n- \"Calm and Headspace help me relax but they don't know anything about MY sleep patterns\" — App Store review\n\n## Quantitative Data\n- Global sleep aids market: $78.7B by 2030 (Grand View Research)\n- Sleep app market: $4.2B by 2027\n- 30% of US adults own a sleep-tracking wearable\n- Average person tries 2.3 sleep apps before giving up\n\n## Risks & Red Flags\n- Very competitive space (Calm, Headspace, Noom, Rise Science)\n- Health claims regulation could limit marketing language\n- Wearable API dependency creates platform risk\n\n## Confidence Rating\n[x] High\nMultiple independent sources confirm the tracking-to-action gap. People are actively searching for solutions and willing to pay.\n\n## Input for Next Phase\nFocus persona research on wearable owners who have ALREADY tried sleep apps and are dissatisfied. They're the low-hanging fruit — problem-aware and solution-seeking.",

Both share the \"data without action\" frustration but for different reasons.\n\n## Evidence & Sources\n- Reddit user analysis across r/sleep, r/OuraRing, r/productivity\n- App Store review sentiment analysis for Sleep Cycle, Oura, WHOOP\n- Huberman Lab / Peter Attia listener demographics\n\n## Key Quotes & Signals\n- Knowledge workers: \"My Apple Watch tells me I got 6 hours but doesn't know I had a 9pm client call in Tokyo timezone\"\n- QS enthusiasts: \"I want to run my own sleep experiments with controlled variables, not follow generic tips\"\n\n## Quantitative Data\n- Primary persona (knowledge workers with wearables): ~12M in US/EU combined\n- Secondary persona (QS enthusiasts): ~2M globally\n- Willingness to pay: €10-25/mo based on comparable health app pricing\n- Average LTV in health apps: 4-8 months at subscription price\n\n## Risks & Red Flags\n- Knowledge workers may churn if results aren't visible within 2-3 weeks\n- QS audience is vocal but small — can't build a business on them alone\n\n## Confidence Rating\n[x] High\nBoth personas are findable, have budget, and express the problem in searchable terms.\n\n## Input for Next Phase\nCompetitor analysis should focus on: what do Oura, WHOOP, Rise Science, and Calm specifically fail at for these two personas?",
          "phase3": "# Phase 3: Competitive Landscape\n## Project: sleepwell\n## Date: 2026-02-20\n\n---\n\n## Findings Summary\nThe market splits into trackers (great data, no coaching) and wellness apps (great content, no personalization). Nobody combines wearable data + calendar context + adaptive coaching. This is the gap.\n\n## Direct Competitors\n\n| Competitor | Pricing | Strengths | Weaknesses | Market Overlap |\n|-----------|---------|-----------|------------|----------------|\n| Oura Ring | €5.99/mo | Best sleep tracking hardware + data | No coaching, just metrics. Users complain about \"so what?\" | High — our users already own this |\n| WHOOP | €30/mo | Strain + recovery coaching for athletes | Too expensive, too athlete-focused, no schedule awareness | Medium — fitness crowd, not knowledge workers |\n| Rise Science | €14.99/mo | Sleep debt concept, energy predictions | Generic advice, no wearable integration, no calendar sync | High — closest competitor in positioning |\n| Calm | €12.99/mo | Massive brand, sleep stories, meditation | Zero personalization, no data integration, content-only | Low — different value prop entirely |\n| Sleep Cycle | €3.33/mo | Cheap, decent alarm feature | Basic tracking only, no coaching, outdated UX | Medium — entry-level users |\n\n## Identified Gaps\n1. No product connects wearable data + calendar for context-aware coaching\n2. Rise Science is closest but doesn't integrate with hardware trackers\n3. All coaching is generic — nobody does personal correlation analysis\n4. No product adapts recommendations to irregular/travel schedules\n\n## Pricing Landscape\n- Budget: €3-6/mo (Sleep Cycle, free tiers)\n- Mid-market: €10-15/mo (Rise, Calm premium)\n- Premium: €25-30/mo (WHOOP)\n- Sweet spot for SleepWell: €14.99/mo (matches Rise, undercuts WHOOP)\n\n## Confidence Rating\n[x] High\nClear gap identified. Competition validates demand while leaving room for differentiation.\n\n## Input for Next Phase\nDifferentiation should lean into: calendar-awareness, personal correlation engine, and \"adaptive\" vs \"prescriptive\" coaching.",
