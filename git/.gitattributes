# > When people collaborate on a project from different operating systems, it becomes easy to end up with mixed line endings in the central git repository. It is also possible for Windows users to accidentally change line endings in an already committed file from `LF` to `CRLF`. Doing so produces a large `git diff`, and if it goes unnoticed during code review, all line-by-line history for the file (`git blame`) gets lost.
